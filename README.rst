Solcore
=======

**Solcore** was born as a modular set of tools, written (almost) entirely in Python 3, to address some of the task we had to solve more. With time, however, it has evolved as a complete semiconductor solver able of modelling the optical and electrical properties of a wide range of solar cells, from quantum well devices to multi-junction solar cells.

Please, visit `Solcore's Documentation <http://docs.solcore.solar>`__, the `Tutorial <docs/source/Examples/tutorial.rst>`__ for a step-by-step example of how to use *Solcore* to model a solar cell and also check the `Examples folder <examples>`__ for more specific information and examples of usage.

Contributors
------------

Solcore is the result of many years of developement by many people,
trying to put together in a consistent way the tools that the `Quantum
Photovoltaics Group at Imperial College
London <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/quantum-photovoltaics/>`__ needs for
its research in solar cells and photovoltaics. The list of contributors
(hopefully I am not forgetting anyone!) is:

-  Thomas Wilson
-  Phoebe Pearce
-  Markus Führer
-  Daniel Farrel
-  Tomos Thomas
