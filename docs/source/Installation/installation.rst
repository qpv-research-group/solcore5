Installation and configuration
==============================

Trying Solcore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can try Solcore without installing anything in your computer by using the online service `MyBinder.org <https://mybinder.org/>`_. To do so, just click in the following badge:

.. image:: https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg
 :target: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qpv-research-group/solcore5/devel

It might take a few minutes to start the server. Be patient! Once launched, this service offers a full-feature Jupyter server with Solcore and all its dependencies installed on it. You can use it to try different features and run the examples shipped with Solcore, but it is not recommended for production: resources in MyBinder are limited and the execution depends on a reliable internet connexion.

Once you are ready to install it in your own machine, go to the next section.

Installing Solcore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Solcore is written mostly in Python, but the Poisson-Drift-diffusion (PDD) solver is written in Fortran to make it more efficient,
and the RCWA (rigorous coupled-wave analysis) solver uses the package S4 which is written in C++.
The following instructions are expected to work in most systems, but check the sections below for OS specific instructions and caveats.
In order to install Solcore in your computer, you will need the following:

- Python >3.7
- pip
- setuptools
- :doc:`a suitable Fortran compiler (only needed for the PDD solver) <compilation>`
- :doc:`the S4 package (only needed for RCWA functionality) <s4_installation>`

*Pip* is normally part of the standard Python installation, but you might need to install it. You also need to make sure
the *setuptools* and *wheel* packages are available. To make sure these packages are installed and up to date, run::

    pip install -U pip setuptools wheel

Now, installing Solcore should be as easy as writing in the terminal::

    pip install solcore

This will download Solcore form the Pypi repository and install the package within the Python packages tree, but it will *NOT* install the PDD solver, for which you need a suitable Fortran compiler :doc:`(read this to install your Fortran compiler) <compilation>`. Assuming you have a Fortran compiler correctly installed and configured, you can install Solcore with the PDD solver by doing::

    pip install solcore
    pip install --no-deps --force-reinstall --install-option="--with_pdd" solcore

**NOTE**: Pip passes the --install-option to all the dependencies of the package and therefore the installation will fail since those dependencies do not have the option "--with_pdd". That is the reason why, for now, Solcore needs to be installed twice: the first one to install Solcore normally with all the dependencies and the second one re-installs Solcore with PDD support. 

And that's all!! Solcore should be available to be used as with any Python package::

    >>> import solcore

        Welcome to Solcore - version 5.6.0
        Copyright (c) 2018, Imperial College, London All rights reserved.

Alternative installation method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, you can `download the source from the Solcore GitHub repository <https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5>`_, either using 'git' or as a zip file using one of the links on the right. If you want to install it, unpack it and run from the directory where *setup.py* is located (you still need *pip*, *setuptools* and *numpy* installed; see above)::

    pip install .

or::

    pip install . --install-option="--with_pdd"

If you want to test first if Solcore will work in your computer, without actually installing it, or if you want to become a developer and therefore you need to have it in a more accessible place, you can test if Solcore works with::

    python setup.py test

This will also install the Solcore dependencies and run a few tests that probe several of the Solcore tools. If it fails, it will indicate which parts failed to work and why, and you could try to solve them. At the moment, this only cover some of Solcore's functionality, but it will be expanded with time. The tests related to the PDD solver will fail, of course, since the PDD solver will not be compiled. If you want to test everything, compiling the the PDD solver, just run::

    python setup.py test --with_pdd

Install in development mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are planning to develop Solcore further, you would want to have all the files in an accessible place but still being able to use the package from other places and examples, behaving as if it were truly installed. For this, install Solcore in development mode. `Download the source from the Solcore GitHub repository <https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5>`_ as above and then::

    pip install -e ".[dev]"

or::

    pip install -e ".[dev]" --install-option="--with_pdd"
    
Solcore uses *pre-commit* to do a few things before commiting the changes (for example, clearing the output of Jupyter Notebooks). The *pre-commit* package is installed automatically with the above commands, but each user needs to be initialise it before it can work. This can be done with::

    pre-commit install
   
Check the `pre-commit webpage <https://pre-commit.com/#3-install-the-git-hook-scripts>`_ for more information on how it works. 

Getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing Solcore (or even without installing it), there are a few things you might want to do in order to personalise it and start using it. These are general instructions that, hopefully, should work in most *NIX systems. Check specific instructions for:

- :doc:`Windows 10 <Solcore_on_Windows>`
- :doc:`Mac OS X <Solcore_on_MacOSX>`

1. **Create a user configuration file:** The first time Solcore is run, it will create a hidden folder in your user directory. This folder will contain the local configuration and will store custom materials and other parameters. You can customize the location of by setting the environmental variable :code:`SOLCORE_USER_DATA`. You can check the current configuration with:

.. code:: python

	from solcore import config
	print(config)
	
You can find all the functionality of the :code:`config` object in `The config_tools`_.

2. **Check Solcore examples:** This is the fastest way of getting started. These examples include all the scripts used in the main Solcore paper in the `Journal of Computational Electronics (2018) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10825-018-1171-3>`_ and a few others to explore other functionality. We hope to increase the number and usefulness of these examples over time. You can try directly the examples using `MyBinder.org <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/qpv-research-group/solcore5/deployment>`_.

3. **Set the location of a SPICE executable and the SMARTS folder:** You will need to do this eventually in order to use those tools::

.. code:: python

	from solcore import config
	
	config.spice('/path/to/the/SPICE/executable')
	config.smarts('/path/to/the/SMARTS/folder')


4. **Installing S4:** The rigorous-coupled wave analysis (RCWA) solver S4, created by the Stanford University, needs to be installed separately using `the fork by Phoebe Pearce <http://github.com/phoebe-p/S4>`_. The original version **does not work** with Python 3.x, only with Python 2. You can find more information about the solver in the `project webpage <http://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/S4/>`_. An example of its use with Solcore is included in the examples folder :doc:`here </Examples/example_optics_comparison>`.

5. **Getting specific information about Solcore:** Even though the documentation "should" be more complete, you can get information about any object in python (including any Solcore function, module and package) using the :code:`help` built-in function, for example::

.. code:: python

	from solcore import config
	help(config)


Problems with the installation
------------------------------

There are several things that can go wrong in the above description, specially in Windows.

1. **The tests associated with the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion solver fail**: This is usually the result of not having a Fortran compiler installed in your system, not being correctly configured or having a temperamental F2PY version, the tool - included in numpy - that makes Fortran code accesible from Python. Please, make sure you follow all the steps indicated in the :doc:`Fortran compiler section <compilation>` and above to have the PDD solver up and running.

2. **Some of the dependencies fail to install**: That is rarely the case, as all dependencies are in the main Python repositories. However, there might be issues with Numpy, Matplotlib and Scipy. Depending on your Python distribution, some of these packages might need to be compiled and it is often easy to get them as a scientific bundle. You can check `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ which provides all these packages together already configured for the correct OS.

3. **The PDD solver throws an error, even though I installed it and the installation appeared to be successful**:
   This can happen if you are trying to call PDD functions when the solcore5 directory (downloaded from GitHub) is
   the current working directory. Try calling the functions from a different working directory (by e.g. copying the file you
   are trying to run to a different directory) and seeing if the error persists.

The config_tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module contains all the functions that will help you to setup and configure your Solcore installation, as it has been highlighted above. The full description of the functions included in this module are:
