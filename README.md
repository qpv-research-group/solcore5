Solcore
=======

**Solcore** was born as a modular set of tools, written (almost) entirely in Python 3, to address some of the task we had to solve more. With time, however, it has evolved as a complete semiconductor solver able of modelling the optical and electrical properties of a wide range of solar cells, from quantum well devices to multi-junction solar cells.

Please, visit [Solcore\'s Documentation](http://docs.solcore.solar), the [Tutorial](docs/source/Examples/tutorial.rst) for a step-by-step example of how to use *Solcore* to model a solar cell and also check the [Examples folder](examples) for more specific information and examples of usage.

------------

Solcore is the result of many years of developement by many people, trying to put together in a consistent way the tools that the [Quantum Photovoltaics Group at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/quantum-photovoltaics/) needs for its research in solar cells and photovoltaics. The list of original contributors (hopefully I am not forgetting anyone!) is below, but check the [contributors list](https://github.com/dalonsoa/solcore5/graphs/contributors) for those currently active:
