    Process the layers in the junction and convert it to a format which can be used by Sesame. This includes unit
    conversions from Solcore base SI units to the units used by Sesame (eV, cm). This function also sets the mesh,
    either from a user-supplied junction.mesh (in m) attribute, or by trying to guess an appropriate mesh depending on the
    doping profile and layer thicknesses. It will also extract the doping profile, which can be supplied in
    the following formats:

        - a constant value for each layer, set by the Nd or Na attribute of the material
        - a doping profile for the whole junction, passed as a function which accepts a depth in the junction in m
          and returns doping in m-3
        - a doping profile for each layer, passed as a function which accepts a depth in the layer in m and returns
          doping in m-3

    which is made up of a single layer, unlike the depletion approximation and Fortran-based PDD solvers.
